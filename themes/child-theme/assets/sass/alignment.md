## The Big Picture

It is our recommendation that new students be provided with a document (preferably a website) that contextualizes all major technologies and concepts to be covered in the program to allow students a high-level understanding of the tools available both to developers and end-users, and the types of services they are trying to engage with, and problems they are trying to solve. 

This document should: 

1) describe the role of each of these tools as they relate to the process of building and maintaining a website (or otherwise contributing to the digital realm), including an introductory single page summary diagram that includes the primary content of all courses,

2) describe the relationships between these tools and entities, including where and how they interact, and if they overlap,

3) use plain language and metaphor, assuming no prior familiarity with web technologies, so as to accommodate both digital newcomers and non-native English speakers who may be familiar with the concepts but not the terminology,

4) provide internal links, diagrams, and a glossary for quick reference,

5) be reviewed by all instructors at the beginning of each school year for possible revision.

This document must include contributions from and be reviewed by all instructors, so as to ensure each instructor assents to the context of their course content. Furthermore, the participation of all instructors will enable instructors to hear each others' opinions and positions on different topics, to reduce instances where they unwittingly provide students with conflicting information. 

Given that this will be a living document, produced through collaborative effort, we will not provide a full outline of this document here, but topics we might suggest for inclusion in the document include (but are not limited to):

1) Architecture: servers; databases; server-side languages (generic); markup language; transfer protocols; client-side scripting; stylesheets; content management systems; user platforms, etc.

2) Development workflow: Design; user research; code review; version control; devOps, etc.

3) Best practices: documentation; DRY; separation of concerns; open standards; performance; SEO; accessibility; usability, etc.

## Workload Balancing

It is our recommendation that instructors share their scheduled student workload, including all assignments, tests and exams, along with time estimates for the required student effort with one another in a single communication channel (i.e. Slack channel) in order to 'smooth' the student effort curve within a semester across all courses. Given this visibility, instructors may negotiate among themselves how to resolve effort spikes.

## Course-wide knowledge goals and timelines

It is our recommendation that a shared set of knowledge goals should be defined by course administrators in collaboration with the instructors. These knowledge goals should be granular so as to include as many topics which may overlap across courses (including across semesters) or may serve as dependencies for other skills. These defined goals should include both language-agnostic concepts (i.e. data types, Objects, Constructors), and technology specific topics (i.e. HTML attributes) that may fall within the scope of more than one course, or may serve as a foundation for skills in other courses.

## Cross-subject knowledge

It is our recommendation that each semester, all instructors provide one another with a 30-minute primer on their course content. As all four instructors will be somewhat familiar with the topics to begin with, this should allow for an in depth learning session.

## Skill sequence

It is our recommendation that an incremental refactor of course content take place, until the sequence of skills taught across courses reflects an 'iterative release' approach. 

Currently, concepts that should be incorporated into development practices from day one are silo'd into courses in the second or even third semester (i.e. Mobile Development and Accessibility, respectively).

Deliverable learning objectives in an iterative approach could be grouped as follows:

1) MVP (Alpha)

The student has full understanding of the technologies required to produce and deploy a static usable, standards-compliant web page.

Front-end technologies (including HTML, CSS, and Javascript) and design to produce accessible, responsive, deployable web pages; SEO; version control; Project management; Usability testing; web certificates

2) Persistent content and complex content (Beta)

The student has full understanding of the technologies required to produce and deploy a usable, secure website with dynamically rendered pages, capable of storing and retrieving user information from a database. This site should handle large volumes of data in a user-friendly way, while passing code review and other quality assurance requirements.

Server-side languages; database design; web services; Security; Quality assurance; devOps; information architecture

3) Robust skillset (Stable release)

The student should have the requisite skills and knowledge to find a place on, and be a valuable member of, a development team.

## Context agnostic skills

We recommend a yearly audit of context-agnostic skills that aren't explicitly the responsibility of any given course, where instructors have found these skills to be lacking, examples of which may include clear email communication; debugging; version control; pseudocode. 

Following the audit, instructors should reach a consensus on how the content should be made available to students. For example, expectations around (along with standards and examples of) clear email communication could be included in the 'Big Picture' document, while version control may be found to fit best in the Web
