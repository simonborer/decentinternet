      <description>What is ARIA? ARIA, or &amp;lsquo;WAI-ARIA&amp;rsquo; (they&amp;rsquo;re the same thing) is a specification from the W3C, just like the specs for HTML, CSS, etc.
It is a set of element attributes meant to supplement native HTML semantics, particularly (but by no means exclusively) by marking up dynamic content, such as tabs, forms and other user interface elements, or &amp;lsquo;live&amp;rsquo; content, like a Twitter feed.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a step back and learn a little about the DOM before we dive into how ARIA adds to the information available to users about what the DOM is doing.</description>

      <description>The internet is open We work on an open platform. The beautiful thing about the internet is that it is a (nearly) global public space built on open access (e.g. Net Neutrality), open standards and open specifications. This comes with the responsibility, that you create services that are meant to be consumed by clients you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with, some that haven&amp;rsquo;t even been invented yet.

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with leaning into your title content   Page Titles Page titles should be unique and descriptive. The content in the title element of your page&amp;rsquo;s head should give users a concise, but solid description of how this page differs from any other page, and what the content is going to be.
If this is the second page in a series of three pages, say so!</description>

      <description>The beginning of things, according to Hans Breinlinger   What is it For a product or service to be accessible, it needs to be something that isn&amp;rsquo;t constrained by the myth of the average person. We make assumptions about people and how they&amp;rsquo;ll interact with the things we make.
