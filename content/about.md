This site and all its content, unless otherwise noted, are made by me, Simon Borer.

I am an educator and web developer based in Toronto, Ontario. If you'd like to hire me, please <a href="#contact">get in touch</a>!

I make this site using <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hugo</a>, <a href="http://proselint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Proselint</a>, <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yarn</a>, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Node</a>, and a plethora of other wonderful open source tools.

The site icon is an adaptation of the very cool work done by the people behind <a href="http://accessibleicon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Accessible Icon Project</a>
