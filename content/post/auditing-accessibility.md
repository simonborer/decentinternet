The W3 provide us with a wonderful list of different accessibility auditing tools, in a wide variety of languages: https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/?q=command-line-tool.

The most commonly used one is the WAVE Browser extension

Chrome also has an accessibility audit built in. Go to the devtools > audits > Perform an audit and deselect everything except 'Accessibility'.
