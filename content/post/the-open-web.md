## The internet is open

We work on an open platform. The beautiful thing about the internet is that it is a (nearly) global public space built on open access (e.g. Net Neutrality), standards and specifications. This comes with the responsibility, though, that you create services that are meant to be consumed by clients that haven't even been invented yet.

You will work with (and by with, I mean for) people who do not understand the difference between accessing a pdf and opening a webpage.

Having an open spec markup language is the backbone of the information age.

Firefox gets most of their money from...Google.

Wait, why?

Google's business model depends on the open web. It has made a multi-billion dollar bet that the best place to be is not in a "walled garden", but as the concierge to the innovations afforded by a democratized space.
