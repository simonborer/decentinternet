You'll learn that when you're in a room full of developers, you'll argue differently.

You will know how to solve problems. You will know the cutting edge of technology. You will feel the inefficiencies start to weigh on you.

What will you do when you're the only person who knows how to make a website accessible?

What will you do when you're the only person who cares about responsive design? Or load times? Or security?

You need to make it so your team understands

You need to make it so your boss doesn't need to understand.

Peer review, linting, automation. You need to get your team to agree to be held accountable.

When you need resources
Get team buy-in

Explain the cost of 2 options, both of which you are ready and willing to implement
